Welcome Investment Agents! Here, we are seeing how well LLM's are at making trading decisions using fundamental financial analysis and daily news.

Here is how to get started:
In terminal... 
    1. Create a virtual environment
        - python3 -m venv venv
    2. Activate the virtual environment
        - source venv/bin/activate 
    3. Install the requirements
        - pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache
    4. Run the backend 
        - python backend/src/agents/orchestration.py

This should pull up a locally hosted environment that all the agents and their analysis.
