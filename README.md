Welcome Investment Agents! Here, I will be doing my best to utilize LLM's to make better investment decisions. This is purely experimental. 

Going to update this later...

1. Be sure to set up the correct environment variables in a .env file under the backend folder
2. Run docker-compose up --build

For now, everything will be back-end functionality. Just give me sometime to figure out javascript

The dataset will be set up in a postgres to hold all of the Balance Sheet / Income Statement data

Hoping to bring in a vector DB and maybe a knowledge graph the understand market sentiment
